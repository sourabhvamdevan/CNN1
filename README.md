# Footwear Classification CNN

This repository contains a Python script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify footwear images into three categories: Boots, Sandals, and Shoes.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple CNN model for image classification using Keras.  It includes data loading, preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation.

## Data

The dataset should be structured as follows:
Footwear/
├── Boot/
│ ├── image1.jpg
│ ├── image2.jpg
│ └── ...
├── Sandal/
│ ├── image1.jpg
│ ├── image2.jpg
│ └── ...
└── Shoe/
├── image1.jpg
└── ...


Make sure all images are in JPG format and adequately represent the three categories.  The code assumes grayscale images.


## Code Description

The Python script (`your_script_name.py`) performs the following tasks:

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Loads image data from specified folders, resizes images to a fixed size, and normalizes pixel values.  Error handling is included to gracefully manage potential issues like missing or corrupted images.
* **Model Creation:** Defines a simple CNN model using Keras layers.  This example includes convolutional layers, max pooling for dimensionality reduction, and a dense output layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification.
* **Data Splitting:** Splits the loaded data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
* **Model Training:** Compiles the model, trains it using the training data, and tracks performance on a validation set.  Epochs and batch size can be adjusted in the code.
* **Evaluation and Visualization:** Evaluates the model on the testing data. The training history (accuracy and loss over epochs) is visualized for better understanding of the training process.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* NumPy
* OpenCV (cv2)
* Keras (or TensorFlow with Keras)
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python keras scikit-learn matplotlib

```

Usage
Prepare your data: Organize your images into the directory structure described above.

Run the script: Execute the Python script.

To run:
python your_script_name.py


Further Improvements
Data Augmentation: Implementing data augmentation techniques can significantly improve model generalization.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Exploring different hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, layer configurations) to optimize performance.

Model Complexity: Consider more complex CNN architectures, like ResNet or InceptionNet, especially if the dataset is large.

Different Loss Functions: Experiment with different loss functions (e.g., categorical crossentropy) suited for multi-class classification.

Improved Image Handling: Handle different image types and sizes gracefully to make the code more robust.
